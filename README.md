# Hello-User-in-Python

This is my first assignment for my Introduction to Programming in Python course. 

Part 1 - Hello User: The program prompts the user for their name, reads in their input, and prints a hello statement.

Part 2 - Assignment Due Date: The program prompts the user for the day, month, year, time (in hours), and time (in minutes) that weekly assignments are due. It will then print the information, with slight date/time formatting, to the user.
